Just a bunch of dotfiles.

NOTE
====

This repo is being phased out in favor of Wanderlust.

Usage
-----

`sudo bash install.bash`

If some dotfiles already exist, those specific symlinks will fail to be created. Resolve your existing dotfiles and then, run the script again.

Then in Vim,

`:BundleInstall` to install all your plugins.
