Scripts
=======

* gitignores - Opens up the suggested (by Github) gitignore for a specific language

Inspiration
===========

I've wanted to create my own scripts suite for a while and I just finally got around to doing it. Adding a new script every day was inspired by [Adam Derewecki](http://derwiki.tumblr.com/post/5387138528/experimenting-with-github-to-increase-personal). The idea that is the daily practice will force me to automate most of the tasks that can be automated in my workflow.

Help with writing scripts

TODO
====

* Figure out a good way to automatically generate man pages or -h options for all these scripts
* Use #! for Ruby scripts
* Have a template for options, help, version (and general good CLI practice) for different languages.
* Something that clones Git repos and puts it locally.

Scripts wanted
---------------

* A history of all the places I've been today that works across many different bash sessions at once.
