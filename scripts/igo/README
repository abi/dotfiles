A simple interactive Go interpreter built on exp/eval with some readline refinements

Note
====

you'll need go-readline bindings from https://bitbucket.org/binet/go-readline

Example
=======

::

  $ igo
  igo> func f() { println("hello world") }
  igo> f()
  hello world

TODO
=====

- investigate the replacement of readline with linenoise (or go-linoise?)

- implement code completion

  - with rlcompleter

  - with linenoise

  - with gocode

- code colorization ?
